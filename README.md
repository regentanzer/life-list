# Life List Data

This repo organizes, vizualizes, and analyzes my birding life list data against the eBird taxonomy so that I can keep track of the taxonomy of the birds I've seen, as well as compare my life list to the world life list at the Family level. 

Initial commit cleans my life list (copied over from eBird and somewhat organized manually), saves as CSV, and builds data visualizations both for my general life list (prefix with ll for life list) and specifically for the life birds I got on my first international birding trip to Panama in July 2025!
